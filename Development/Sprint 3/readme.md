   1. Task Flow
   2. Task Flow/Tracking from Service Seeker/Client side
   3. Task Flow/Tracking from Service Provider/Tasker side

3. **List of Extra Tasks**

   - **Backend Rebuild**
     - Rebuilding the Whole Database schema in MongoDB
     - Developing All routes and handlers for all Use Cases from sprint 1 to 3
     - Coding Easy to access Api Endpoints
     - Accurate Error handling (in case of OK status, Not Found, Bad request, Server error, or Database Checks)
     - Frontend Error Handling, updated according to New Backend.
   **Reasoning**: Because of the DDD (Domain Driven Development) structure in Flask Backend and recurring complications at the smallest changes, we had to move our backend to NodeJs to speed up the development process and that's why we were able to at least present Ujret on Sproj Display Day.

## How to Access the System

### A) Install APK File

- You can get the APK file here [Sprint3_apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J4AoIEJN8IfSzJAhJOkbVdRNtOP_TEIo/view?usp=sharing) 
- Node Backend is Deployed on Render deployed server link [https://ujret-backend-node.onrender.com/api/v1](https://ujret-backend-node.onrender.com/api/v1) 
Note that the backend may take 45-50s to start on the first call after being inactive for a day. That's Because Backend is currently deployed on free version of Render ![image](https://github.com/talha-husnain/P05-Ujret_Mobile_App/assets/88245647/5e4b9434-af73-4956-b266-b8c8bab9e4be)
- Flask Backend is also Accessible here [https://ujret-python-api.onrender.com/api/v1](https://ujret-python-api.onrender.com/api/v1).
 

### B) Run Code Locally

You can directly run the code (Frontend on android emulator) and (backend on powershell). Details are given below

#### How To Access the System Locally

1. **Run Frontend Locally**
2. **Run Node Backend Locally**
3. **Run Flask Backend Locally**

### (1) Run Frontend Locally

#### Getting Started

Note: Make sure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup instructions till "[Creating a new application](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)" step, before proceeding.

###### Go to the Frontend directory

```bash
  cd Front_End_React_Native
```

##### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

###### using npm

```bash
  npm start
```

###### OR using Yarn

```bash
  yarn start
```

##### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

##### For Android

###### using npm

```bash
  npm run android
```

###### OR using Yarn

```bash
  yarn android
```

##### For iOS

###### using npm

```bash
  npm run ios
```

###### OR using Yarn

```bash
  yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### (2) Run Node Backend Locally

###### Run these commands one by one in the Node backend main Directory

```bash
  npm i
```
```bash
  node index.js
```

### (3) Run Flask Backend Locally

#### Getting Started

Note: Make sure you have completed the Environment Setup, before proceeding.

- Environment Setup
  Install Postgres Sql Locally, setup its database
  Install Datagrip to access databases because its accessible, create a project on datagrip using postgres sql as database.
  Go to the backend/db/migrations/0-1.sql, copy the sql and paste it on new create project's console on datagrip
  Run the Sql on console and the setup is done

- To run backend follow the following steps.

- Go to the backend directory

```bash
  cd backend
```

#### Database Setup

- Add environment variables (get credentials from datagrip, rename file to .env)

```bash
DB_HOST=
DB_NAME=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_PORT=
DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=
```

- Run SQL in DataGrip console (copy, paste and run)

```text
0-1.sql
```

#### Running Flask Server

- Set up and activate virtual environment (optional)

```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
```

- Install dependencies

```bash
  cd backend
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Start the server

```bash
  // from backend directory
  flask --app core.api.api  --debug run
```
