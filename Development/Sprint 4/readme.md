# Ujret Mobile Application - Sprint 4

- Build APK of Sprint 4 can be accessed from here [Sprint4_apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-HjsBnLsIZtQ-EUvEeRBBMOT9dcPNVPo/view?usp=sharing) 
- Demo video of sprint 4 can be accessed from here [Sprint4_Demo-video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dXOEqxaMrzDU_S0XrD1OYqb-hW4IqxX_/view?usp=sharing)

Please Note the following details before Accessing Apk
- The app app needs an active internet connection on the device to run smoothly.
- The backend will not restart auto if backend is inactive for 24+ hours, in that case a call should be manually made on this endpoint [https://ujret-backend-node.onrender.com/api/v1](https://ujret-backend-node.onrender.com/api/v1) to start server, that's because the backend is deployed on Render free service, which requires a call to start it. If a manual call is not made, the backend takes 40-50 seconds to start on the free service of render which in case delays loading on app slash screen.
- To login to Test Users, you can access system through any of the given creds.

## How to Access the System

### A) Install APK File

- You can get the APK file here [Sprint4_apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-HjsBnLsIZtQ-EUvEeRBBMOT9dcPNVPo/view?usp=sharing) 
- Node Backend is Deployed on Render deployed server link [https://ujret-backend-node.onrender.com/api/v1](https://ujret-backend-node.onrender.com/api/v1) 
Note that the backend may take 45-50s to start on the first call after being inactive for a day. That's Because Backend is currently deployed on free version of Render ![image](https://github.com/talha-husnain/P05-Ujret_Mobile_App/assets/88245647/5e4b9434-af73-4956-b266-b8c8bab9e4be)
- Flask Backend is also Accessible here [https://ujret-python-api.onrender.com/api/v1](https://ujret-python-api.onrender.com/api/v1).
 

### B) Run Code Locally

You can directly run the code (Frontend on android emulator) and (backend on powershell). Details are given below

#### How To Access the System Locally

1. **Run Frontend Locally**
2. **Run Node Backend Locally**

### (1) Run Frontend Locally

#### Getting Started

Note: Make sure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup instructions till "[Creating a new application](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)" step, before proceeding.

###### Go to the Frontend directory

```bash
  cd Ujret-Frontend-ReactNative
```

##### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

###### using npm

```bash
  npm start
```

###### OR using Yarn

```bash
  yarn start
```

##### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

##### For Android

###### using npm

```bash
  npm run android
```

###### OR using Yarn

```bash
  yarn android
```

##### For iOS

###### using npm

```bash
  npm run ios
```

###### OR using Yarn

```bash
  yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### (2) Run Node Backend Locally
First, Copy env from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ItTW_Pw-x1zbPix6rG_ntZJ0IJ--SqWk/view?usp=sharing), and paste it in Sprint 4/Ujret-Backend-Node folder and then follow the steps below.

###### Run these commands one by one in the Node backend main Directory

```bash
  npm i
```
```bash
  node index.js
```
